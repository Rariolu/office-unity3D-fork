## Why is it here?
This game project was created and developed by my friends and I. Though, we were unable to finish it 
due to the busy schedules of everyone. Hence, I pushed the project up here, so you can use the project
as your own project. I will keep the original storyline, and let you create your own story for this game!

## What have we developed?
The game environment is complete; the models are properly placed. Several interaction and system algorithms
are implements, if not, done.

## Getting Started
Software that you will need to work on this project:

* [Unity3D](https://store.unity.com) - Game Engine
* [Blender](https://www.blender.org/download/) - 3D Modeling, can use any other alternatives

The project is ready-to-go once you download it! One problem is that, you have to bake the whole lighting system again. :)

## Screenshots
To be added soon.
