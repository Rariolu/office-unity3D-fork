## Why is it here?
This game project was created and developed by my friends and I. Though, we were unable to finish it 
due to the busy schedules of everyone. Hence, I pushed the project up here, so you can use it
as your own project. I will not upload the original storyline, and let you create your own story for this game!

## What have we developed?
The game environment is complete; the models are properly placed. Several interaction and system algorithms
are implemented, if not, done.

## Getting Started
### Software that you will need to work on this project:

* [Unity3D](https://store.unity.com) - Game Engine
* [Blender](https://www.blender.org/download/) - 3D Modeling, can use any other alternatives

### Installing the Project:
The project is ready-to-go once you download it! Open the scene file and you are all set. One problem is that you have to bake the whole lighting system again. :)

## Screenshots
To be added soon.
